# TML Driving Record Dashboard

## A dashboard showing the status of driving record data coming from the DMV of the 50 states and territories. 
- A user can view the status of data, whether up or down
- A user can see if the outage is planned or unknown
- A user can create, edit or delete known upcoming outages
- A user can add notes (a story) along the way documenting steps taken to address outage

## TML Dashboard uses Rails 6 as a backend API and React/Redux for frontend. The original app used AWS for database needs.
